# Docs to Markdown conversion tool

I've used many markdown conversion tools but many of them still generate errors so I decided to use Claude Code and Cursor to generate one that perfect meet my needs. Feel free to use it. 

## How to use this markdown conversion tool 

Basically, just copy and paste your text from google docs, lark docs or any other word files, this tool automatically converts all the rich text into the markdown format. It also allows you to adjust the generated text.
